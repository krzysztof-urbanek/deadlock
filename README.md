# deadlock

**A JPA Spring project showcasing deadlock scenarios and ways of avoiding them.** (Also, the project demonstrates how to setup multiple databases for a single project: check the **1_multiple_databases** branch)

The tests require **infrastructure/docker-compose.yaml** running. Some of the tests are failing, because some of the included solutions are erroneous.
