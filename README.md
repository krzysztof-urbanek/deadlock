# deadlock

**A Spring Data JPA project showcasing deadlock scenarios and ways of avoiding them.** (Also, the project demonstrates how to setup multiple databases for a single project: check the **1_multiple_databases** branch)

The tests require **infrastructure/docker-compose.yaml** running (one of the images has to be built from the infrastructure/Dockerfile). Some of the tests are failing, because some of the included solutions are purposefully erroneous.
